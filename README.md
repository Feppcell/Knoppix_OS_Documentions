## Introduction

Knoppix is a powerful Linux distribution that runs from a live CD or USB. This project provides a comprehensive guide on how to install Knoppix OS in a virtual machine. It also dives into the implementation of the `getppid` system call, offering insights into how processes interact in Linux.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A computer with virtualization support.
- Virtualization software such as VirtualBox or VMware.
- Basic knowledge of Linux commands.

### Installation Steps

1. **Download Knoppix ISO**: Visit the official Knoppix website to download the latest ISO file.
2. **Set Up Virtual Machine**:
   - Open your virtualization software.
   - Create a new virtual machine.
   - Allocate memory and disk space as needed.
   - Load the Knoppix ISO as the boot disk.
3. **Boot the Virtual Machine**: Start the virtual machine and follow the on-screen instructions to install Knoppix.
4. **Explore the System**: Once installed, you can explore Knoppix and its features.

For detailed installation instructions, refer to the [Releases](https://github.com/Feppcell/Knoppix_OS_Documentions/releases) section.

## Understanding System Calls

### What is a System Call?

A system call is a way for programs to request services from the operating system's kernel. System calls provide an interface for applications to interact with the hardware and manage resources.

### The `getppid` System Call

The `getppid` system call returns the process ID of the parent process. This is useful for processes that need to know their parent, such as when managing child processes.

#### Example Usage

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t ppid = getppid();
    printf("Parent Process ID: %d\n", ppid);
    return 0;
}
```

## Virtual Machines

### Why Use a Virtual Machine?

Virtual machines allow you to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine. This is ideal for testing, development, and educational purposes.

### Setting Up a Virtual Machine

1. **Choose Your Virtualization Software**: Popular options include VirtualBox, VMware, and Hyper-V.
2. **Install the Software**: Follow the installation instructions for your chosen software.
3. **Create a New Virtual Machine**: Allocate resources and load the Knoppix ISO.
4. **Start the Virtual Machine**: Boot from the ISO and follow the installation steps.
